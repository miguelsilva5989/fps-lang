# FPS Lang

A `frames per second` meme programming language ðŸ™ƒ

The concept of this language is to execute statements on a `per frame` level

This lexing/parsing concept is based on the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

The weird `FPS` part was just a silly idea I had when thinking about `frames per second` in video games ðŸ™ƒ

## Logic

### Frame concept

\# represents a frame

```rust
let a=1; # print(a); ## <- exit program on last frame
^        ^
|        |_frame 1 -> 'print(a);' will be executed on frame 2
frame 0 -> 'let a = 1;' will be executed on frame 1
```

### Weird example

And this is where `FPS Lang` shines at being `weird` ðŸ¤£

```rust
// this is FRAME 0
print("printed at frame 1 - declared at frame 0");
let a = 0;

#3 // frame 1 will be executed 3 times
print("printed at frames 2|3|4 - declared at frame 1");

for 0..=1 {
    print("printed at frames 2|3|4|5|6|7 - declared at frame 1 inside for loop"); 
    a = a + 1;
    print(a);
}

# // frame 4
print("printed at frame 5 - declared at frame 4");
print(a); // should print 4
##
```

output
```rust
FPS 1 -> printed at frame 1 - declared at frame 0
FPS 2 -> printed at frames 2|3|4 - declared at frame 1
FPS 2 -> printed at frames 2|3|4|5|6|7 - declared at frame 1 inside for loop
FPS 2 -> 1 // 'a' value - printed inside for loop
FPS 3 -> printed at frames 2|3|4 - declared at frame 1
FPS 3 -> printed at frames 2|3|4|5|6|7 - declared at frame 1 inside for loop
FPS 3 -> 2 // 'a' value - printed inside for loop
FPS 4 -> printed at frames 2|3|4 - declared at frame 1
FPS 4 -> printed at frames 2|3|4|5|6|7 - declared at frame 1 inside for loop
FPS 4 -> 3 // 'a' value - printed inside for loop
FPS 5 -> printed at frames 2|3|4|5|6|7 - declared at frame 1 inside for loop
FPS 5 -> 4 // 'a' value - printed inside for loop
FPS 5 -> printed at frame 5 - declared at frame 4
FPS 5 -> 4 // 'a' value - printed at frame 5 (declared at frame 4)
FPS 6 -> printed at frames 2|3|4|5|6|7 - declared at frame 1 inside for loop
FPS 6 -> 5 // 'a' value - printed inside for loop
FPS 7 -> printed at frames 2|3|4|5|6|7 - declared at frame 1 inside for loop
FPS 7 -> 6 // 'a' value - printed inside for loop
```


## Types

Currently supported types

| Type                 | Declaration |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Int                  | 1           |
| Float                | 1. or 1.0   |
| String               | "value"     |
| Boolean              | true        |
| Range(int, int)      | 0..1        |
| RangeEqual(int, int) | 0..1=       |
| Null                 | null        |


### Syntax

#### Frame

`#` represents a frame

```rust
let a = 0;
print(a);
# 
print(a);
##
```

output
```rust
FPS 1 -> 0
FPS 2 -> 0
```

#### FPS Program end

`##` represents the end of the program

#### Declaration / Assignment

Use `let` to declare a variable.

```rust
let a = 0;
```

#### Range

Use `..` surround by 2 digits to define a `Range`

- `Range` is bound inclusively below and exclusively above

Ranges can also be `RangeEqual` by adding a `=` sign to the range `0..=1`

- `RangeEqual` is bound inclusively below and inclusively above.

#### For loop

```rust
for 0..2 { print("hello"); } ##
```

output
```rust
FPS 1 -> hello
FPS 2 -> hello
```

#### If/Else block

```rust
if 0 == 1 {
    print("equals");
} else {
    print("not equals");
}
```

#### Block with scope logic

```rust
let a = 1;

{
    let b = 1;
    print(a + b);
}

##
```

output
```rust
FPS 1 -> 2
```
